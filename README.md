Applications covered in this book include optimization, finance, statistical mechanics, birth and death processes, and gambling systems.

## About this repo
I'm working through the end-of-chapter exercises and projects for this book. The R code I used will be included here, as well as any Markdown documents if I decide to be fancy about my write-ups.
